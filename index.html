<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Kamala Pillai!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a student at Cal. I started building this website just as a way to put off stats homework, but the more time I spend
		on it the more invested I become in this idea of having my own inspirational blog. I like to read, and my favorite book currently is  
		<em>Boys in the Boat</em>. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
