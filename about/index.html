	<h1 class="about">ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1>
	<p class ="about">I originally built this website as a way to teach myself web design with HTML and CSS. On that note, please let me know if you have any suggestions related
  to the layout of the site. I appreciate the feedback!</p>
  <p class="about">The blog has since become my creative outlet. All of the posts on the website have been adapted from entries in my personal journal. My
  hope is that site visitors will find inspiration and light in some of these articles. Again, I love hearing your comments about the website and the blog, so email away!</p>

	<h1 class="about">ABOUT KAMALA</h1>
	<p class="about">I moved around a lot in my early childhood, but I did most of my growing up in the South Bay Area in California. I later earned my Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering
	from UC Berkeley, with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm currently doing my Master's in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson School of Management.</p>
	<p class="about">As I write this we're in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Apart from school and blogging, I've been keeping myself sane with a bunch of different hobbies.
	Lately I've been most occupied with yoga and guitar. How have you been spending your quarantine?</p>
