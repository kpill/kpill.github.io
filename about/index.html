	<h1 class="about">ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1>
	<p class ="about">I originally built this website as a way to teach myself web design with HTML and CSS. On that note, please let me know if you have any suggestions related
  to the layout of the site. I appreciate the feedback!</p>
  <p class="about">The blog is my creative outlet. I'm big into writing and journaling, and many of the posts on the website have been adapted from entries in my personal journal. Everyday I have the
	  opportunity to learn something from another person. My hope is that I can give back by sharing my own revelations and lessons in the blog, and continue the chain of inspiration.</p>

	<h1 class="about">ABOUT KAMALA</h1>
	<p class="about">I moved around a bit as a kid, but I did most of my growing up in the South Bay Area in California. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering
	from UC Berkeley, with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Now I'm doing my Master's in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson School of Management. So yes,
	Californian through and through. </p>
	<p class="about">As I write this we're in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Apart from school and blogging, I've been keeping myself sane with a bunch of different hobbies.
	Recently it's been a lot of yoga and a lot of guitar. If you're reading this during the pandemic, I hope you're staying safe and being well. If you're not reading this
	during the pandemic, then I should probably update this page.</p>
